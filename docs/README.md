*Only tested with Synapse*
## Instructions
1. Join our [Discord](discord.gg/XgFMtkGuQj)
2. Copy the key from the #key text channel
3. Open your Synapse root directory and navigate to the `autoexec` folder.
4. Create a new script and copy this code into it: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyr0zn/Specter/main/loader.lua"))()`
5. Run Synapse and attach it to a running Roblox instance.
6. Open Phantom Forces and paste in the copied key

Note that this cheat **only** works when in the autoexec folder. This is because the Phantom Forces developers have a quasi anticheat that requires a bypass to be loaded before the game loads.
