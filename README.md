# Specter
Phantom Forces cheat script

* *Only tested with Synapse* *
## Instructions
1. Open your Synapse root directory and navigate to the `autoexec` folder.
2. Create a new script and copy this code into it: `loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyr0zn/Specter/main/loader.lua"))()`
3. Run Synapse and attach it to a running Roblox instance.
4. Once injected, open Phantom Forces and the cheat will load itself into your game.

Note that this cheat **only** works when in the autoexec folder. This is because the Phantom Forces developers have a quasi anticheat that requires a bypass to be loaded before the game loads.
